This repository contains the source code for the SCFirstOrderLogic.ExampleDomains NuGet package.

## Package Documentation

This package is documented as a (rather minor) part of the documentation for the SCFirstOrderLogic package - see https://sdcondon.net/SCFirstOrderLogic/.

## Source Documentation

I haven't written up any documentation of the source (e.g. repo overview, design discussion, compilation guidance…) - because frankly, it is not worth it.
Once cloned, it should "just work" as far as compilation is concerned.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not really expecting anyone to want to get involved at this stage, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep an eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCFirstOrderLogic.ExampleDomains/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
